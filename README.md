# My React Application

This is a React application built with Node.js version 21.0.0⁹[^10^]¹¹.

## About React and AngularJS

**React** is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components². It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram³.

**AngularJS**, on the other hand, is a JavaScript framework that extends HTML with new attributes, making it perfect for Single Page Applications (SPAs)⁷. It was developed by Miško Hevery, a Google employee⁷.

## Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js version 21.0.0 installed on your machine⁹.

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on. Packages are dropped into the `node_modules` directory under the folder where the `npm install` command was run.

## Building the Application

To build the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command creates an optimized production build of your application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Deployment

The `build` directory contains all the files needed to run this application. These files can be served by any static file server, but in this case we will use Nginx.

## License

Please replace "My React Application" with the name of your application and add any additional sections as needed.
